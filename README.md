Automated Data ETL Pipeline with Apache Airflow on AWS EC2
This project implements an automated data ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Apache Airflow on an AWS EC2 instance.

##Project Overview##

This project demonstrates how to:

Extract data from Openweather Using API Key.
Transform and clean the data using Python scripts
Load the processed data in a AWS S3 Bucket
Schedule and orchestrate the entire pipeline using Apache Airflow
Deploy the pipeline onto an AWS EC2 instance for automated execution

##Technologies Used##

Apache Airflow: Workflow orchestration platform
Python: Scripting language for data transformation
AWS EC2: Cloud-based virtual machine instance

##Project Structure##

dags: Contains Airflow DAG files defining the pipeline workflows
plugins: (Optional) Custom Airflow plugins (if needed)
scripts: Python scripts for data extraction, transformation, and loading
config: Configuration files for Airflow and data connections

##Prerequisites##

Basic understanding of ETL processes
Familiarity with Python and scripting
AWS account with necessary permissions
An EC2 instance configured with Airflow

##Getting Started##

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/RambabuKarravula/ETL-Pipeline.git
Configure the project:
Update the config files with your specific data sources, credentials, and target destination configurations.
Edit the DAG files in the dags folder to customize the pipeline tasks and schedule.
Deploy to AWS EC2:
Follow the instructions in the deployment documentation (not included in this example) to set up and deploy the project on your EC2 instance.
Run the pipeline:
Once deployed, use the Airflow web interface to access and trigger the pipeline manually or configure scheduled execution.

##Additional Notes##

This is a template and might need modifications based on your specific requirements.
Refer to the documentation within the project for detailed instructions and customization options.
Consider implementing best practices for security, logging, and error handling in your production environment.
